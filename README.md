## App Brainstorming
- Ebay:

    - Auctions for old parts 

- TikTok
    - Personalized for you page
    - TikTok Shop

    - Recommends new and exciting restaurants 
    - Deals and offers given constantly 

- My Idea:
I would like to a card swap collectable game that relies on apple NFC touch. The inspiration for this idea came from the contact swap through the nfc at the top of Iphones. I thought what if we could make something like a fun game getting people to interact with each other. This also takes a little inspiration from StreetPass from the nintendo switch. The main premise is you create a character, your character meets other character with other people who have the app. But the only way to meet is in person where the two users tap their iPhones and their characters are digitally tranferred to the other persons phone. The Characters you collect the more points you earn. Each character you collect will also be added to your village. So the more people you meet the bigger your village gets. There would be more features and ideas but this would be the core premise.
